Github wouldn't let me save any of my resource folders in my repo because the files were too large. This messed up my entire directory for the whole project. The file directory for the repo and the file directory for the csv files were supposed to be consistent throughout the project, but because github would not let me upload any of my resource files, I had to put them in a seperate folder and it messed up everything.
 I did what I could.
